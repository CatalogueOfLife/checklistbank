## How to contribute

ChecklistBank welcomes all datasets about global, regional or thematic taxonomies.
National faunas and floras, redlists, monographs, legal species lists and many more.

You can [create a dataset](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset), author metadata and publish updates to your data yourself with your existing [GBIF account](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile).

## Contribute to the Catalogue of Life

The Catalogue of Life has known weak areas in which we always look for contributions.
COL includes both static publications for taxonomic groups, but ideally prefer an active group of experts
that curate a taxonomic group of any size globally. If you are interested please contact us at contact@catalogueoflife.org.

### Missing sectors

Some areas in COL have full gaps for which we do not know any species at all.
These areas are often filled with genera only provided by the [Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/dataset/2007).

- Symphyta (Hymenoptera)
- [Chrysidinae & Cleptinae](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/browse?taxonKey=87J) (Hymenoptera)
- [Diplura](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/taxon/6222Y)
- Algae & Protozoa/Chromista, see [IRMNG](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/dataset/2007)
- ...

### Static sectors

Other sections in the Catalogue of Life contain most species, but are based on an inactive community or are taken from a single publication that does not change. We welcome active communities to become the official source and replace our stale data with their ongoing contributions.
