## How to contribute

ChecklistBank wants to be an open platform for sharing data that helps
to discover and (re)use resources.
We welcome all datasets about global, regional or thematic taxonomies.
National faunas and floras, redlists, monographs, legal species lists and many more.

## Share your data

In order to share your data on CheckistBank it needs to be in one of the [supported formats](/about/formats). The preferred format is [ColDP](/about/formats#catalogue-of-life-data-package-coldp), which is the most expressive and the closest to our internal data model.

Starting with version 3 you can also use GBIF's Integrated Publishing Toolkit ([IPT](https://www.gbif.org/ipt)) to create ColDP archives from your data.

Once you have a dataset archive you can [create a dataset](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset) in ChecklistBank and upload your data, author metadata and publish updates to your data yourself with your existing [GBIF account](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile).
