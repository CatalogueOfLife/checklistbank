# Catalogue of Life â€” ChecklistBank UI

The Catalogue of Life ChecklistBank is an environment to place taxonomic and nomenclatural information from different sources in different formats into a consistent data model exposed with a rich API.

The UI allows public exploring of all data in ChecklistBank. It is also a tool for assembling taxonomic checklists from multiple sources for authorized users. Source checklists can be imported in several formats and quality checks are applied during import. ChecklistBank includes tools for duplicate detection and allows for editorial decisions to be recorded and applied repeatedly when syncronising data from sources to an assembled checklist.
